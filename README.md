# CPU Scheduling Simulator
This project is a simple CPU scheduling simulator.
It demonstrates how CPU processes are managed and scheduled using
basic data structures.

## Features
- Add, edit, delete CPU processes
- Priority-based scheduling
- Calculates waiting time and turnaround time
- Stores data and results in external text files

## Data Structures Used
- Linked List
- Queue
- Priority Queue

## Files
- `processes.txt` : Stores process information
- `priority_output.txt` : Stores scheduling results

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using any C++ compiler
2. Run the executable
3. Use the menu to manage processes and run scheduling
